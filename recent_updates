V1.0.0 release!

1. Install GCR on multiple different operating systems with just one command! (It even supports one-click installation on NUS HPC and NSCC Singapore!) ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

2. Users can see detailed update content for each update.

3. Support command `$ delf` : When you use safe-rm, if you are sure that you need to completely delete the file/folder without putting it in the Recycle Bin, use this command.

Comming soon:

1. Use dynamic soft link mapping to make hpc's file access on computing nodes and login nodes more unified.
