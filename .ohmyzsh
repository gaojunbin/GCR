# by Junbin Gao <junbingao at hust dot edu dot cn>
# Note:
#   1. only for zsh, not support bash
#   2. support: combined with .ohmyshell
#   2. rely on [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
#   3. rely on some external plugins
#       + [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) - External wonderful theme, put it to $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/
#       + [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) - Font style support, install it for item2 to use
#       + [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#patched-fonts) - More powerful font style support, install it for item2 to use
#       + [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - Highlight syntax, put it to $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
#       + [zsh-autosuggestions](https://githxub.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) - autosuggestions, put it to $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
#       + [zsh-myincr](https://github.com/gaojunbin/zsh-myincr) - More powerful autosuggestions, put it to $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
#   4. for more detals, you can ref [zshrc.zsh-template in ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/templates/zshrc.zsh-template)
# How to use:
# >> echo 'source ~/.ohmyzsh' >> ~/.zshrc

# Uncomment the following line if you want to disable oh-my-zsh auto update.
DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE="true"

# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
export ZSH=$HOME/.oh-my-zsh

# Set name of the theme to load
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes for more details
# Recommended theme: agnoster, powerlevel9k/powerlevel10k
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
# More detals can ref https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k/wiki/Show-Off-Your-Config
# Uncomment the following line if use powerlevel10k theme and use a specific theme
# source ~/.p9k.zsh

# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
