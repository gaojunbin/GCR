####  üî• **Tssh & trzsz** - ssh Login and terminal file transfer

üí° **Function description**Ôºö

Trzsz tssh is a tool that reshapes the terminal ssh login method and the local-server file transfer method. The ultimate goal is to cooperate with the native ssh tool to achieve a more elegant and convenient server login, and at the same time give the terminal file visual transfer function.

‚Ä¢	**server login**ÔºöTssh can list all available server details, and you can interactively search and select the server you need to connect to.

‚Ä¢	**file transfer**ÔºöSupport file/folder transfer in the terminal: 1. Local to server - drag and drop (what you see is what you get); 2. Server to local - download files/folders

üîó **Installation command**Ôºö

```bash
# Local computer (supports Mac OS, Ubuntu, Win, for more details please refer to https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz-ssh self-installation)
install_tssh

# remote server
install_trzsz
```

üîó **Usage**Ôºö

```bash
# Connect to server
tssh

# Upload files/folders
upload # Or drag and drop directly

# Download files/folders
download File1 Folder2
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Description:

‚Ä¢	Tssh supports mainstream operating systems (Mac OS, Ubuntu, Win), but the interactive interface may not be called in virtual machines or win subsystems without visual interfaces.

‚Ä¢	Tssh is compatible with native ssh and supports rich custom configuration solutions, greatly improving efficiency and experience. Please refer to the [official website](https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz-ssh) to read detailed configuration rules. Here is a template for reference (compatible with native ssh) `~/.ssh/config`:

```yaml
# All servers forward port 59863 to the local machine (for use by the code command, another highly recommended feature)
# All servers tssh supports drag and drop file upload
Host *
    RemoteForward 59863 127.0.0.1:52698
    #!! EnableDragFile Yes

# All servers starting with nscc are classified under the nus label and nscc label
Host nscc*
    #!! GroupLabels NUS
    #!! GroupLabels NSCC

# Log in node information and hide the server
Host nscc
    HostName aspire2a.nus.edu.sg
    User username
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/nus/nscc
    #!! HideHost yes

# Real login node (specify login to nus01 node)
Host nscc-nus01  
    HostName asp2a-login-nus01
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/nus/nscc
    ProxyJump nscc
```



#### üî• **Autojump** - Quick directory jump

üí° **Function description**Ôºö

Autojump is an intelligent directory jumping tool that can quickly locate directories based on the frequency of directories you have visited. By learning your operating habits, it allows you to jump to commonly used paths by entering only part of the directory, greatly improving work efficiency.

‚Ä¢	**Automatic learning path**ÔºöDirectories with more visits will jump faster.

‚Ä¢	**Minimalist commands**ÔºöJust j + the directory name you want to go to. The directory name does not need to be accurate. It supports fuzzy matching and does not need to find the path step by step.

üîó **Installation command**Ôºö
```bash
install_autojump
```

üîó **Usage**Ôºö

```bash
j Any fuzzy keywords for where you want to go
```



#### üî• **Saferm** - Safe delete file/folder

üí° **Function description**Ôºö

Saferm is a safe deletion tool that replaces the native rm. You don‚Äôt need to pay attention to whether you delete files or folders. del can delete them all and automatically put them into the designated recycle bin for easy retrieval, making it easy to delete files. More convenient and safer.

‚Ä¢	**Easy to operate**ÔºöWhether it is a file or a folder, you can delete them all with just one command.

‚Ä¢	**Safe and easy to recover**Ôºödel will be put into the designated recycle bin by default, and you can easily retrieve it in the recycle bin. When there are multiple files with the same name, the deletion time suffix will be automatically added, so all information is safe!

‚Ä¢	**Smart space management**ÔºöIn order to prevent the recycle bin from taking up too much disk space, del will check the file size when deleting. When the deleted file exceeds 10 G, you will be prompted whether to put it in the recycle bin. You can also use delf to manually delete permanently (delf is equivalent to native rm, but it also doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs a file or a folder)

‚Ä¢	**Easily empty the Recycle Bin**Ôºöempty_trash clears the recycle bin with one click and supports two modes: clear all contents of the recycle bin with one click and delete files older than 30 days.

üîó **Installation command**Ôºö

```bash
install_safe_rm

# Optional (recommended): Set the path to the recycle bin (recommended to store it in .zshrc)
export SAFE_RM_TRASH=$HOME/.Trash
```

üîó **Usage**Ôºö

```bash
# Delete files/folders (put in recycle bin)
del Êñá‰ª∂Âêç/Êñá‰ª∂Â§πÂêç
# Delete files/folders (without putting them in the recycle bin)
delf Êñá‰ª∂Âêç/Êñá‰ª∂Â§πÂêç
# Empty Recycle Bin
empty_trash
```



#### üî• **Code** - Terminal editor

üí° **Function description**Ôºö

Code is a rmate-based tool that allows you to edit code/files in the terminal more intuitively, thus eliminating VI/VIM. Suitable for situations when you want to lightly edit files but don't want to use vim.

‚Ä¢	**Automatically identify local and server**ÔºöThe code will automatically identify whether the current terminal is local or remote and enable the corresponding logic to let you edit the file.

‚Ä¢	**Local file editing**ÔºöCode will directly use sublime text vs code to open the current file/folder, save and close it after editing. There is no need to search for and open the corresponding file in the editor, or use vim to edit in the terminal.

‚Ä¢	**Server file editing**ÔºöCode will automatically synchronize the remote file to local temporary storage, and use local sublime text vs code to open the file. After editing, just save and close, and the code will automatically be synchronized to the server. The entire synchronization process does not require any user operation, and is the same process as editing local files.

üîó **Installation command**Ôºö

```bash
# server
install_discard_vim

# Modify the local configuration according to the server-side prompts, mainly including:
# 1. Vscode/sublime plug-in (used to support rmate)
# 2. tssh config port forwarding
```

üîó **Usage**Ôºö

```bash
code FileName
```

## üìã User Guide

### 1. First time use
   - After installing GCR, it is recommended to install tssh locally and improve the ssh config configuration for a better experience
   - Read the recommended must-installs and install the features you are interested in (strongly recommended to install them all)
   - Organize the environment configuration of the original shell, organize the environment variables that need to be retained into a new file, and source the file in ~/.zshrc

### 2. The Logic of GCR

GCR is implemented based on oh-my-zsh, and customizes some functions of ohmyzsh, including terminal display themes, styles, activated plug-ins, etc., and enables automatic prompts and completion by default (fixes the bugs in the original version). In addition, the core functions mainly include GCR version management, ohmyshell, ohmytool.



The overall functional function follows the first, second and third grading standards. (As the version is updated, more first-level functions may be supported, but the logic of level-by-level calls will continue to be inherited)Ôºà‚ö†Ô∏èSecond-level functions are not yet implemented under ohmytoolÔºâ

Second-level functions include various functional module functions subordinate to each first-level function, such as personalized functions for anaconda, pip and other modules; second-level functions can access all third-level functions;

Third-level functions include specific functional functions under each module to perform a specific function;



Users only need to memorize one-level functions to access all gcr functions!
